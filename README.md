# TechBlog

The purpose of this assignment is to create a CMS style blog that allows users to sign in, create posts, comment on those posts.
More importantly to have authorization on the page so that users can sign in with a username and password and then be able to resign in.
These values should be checked to ensure that they match a registered user.

There should be navigation between the homepage, the dashboard and the log out pages.
And blog posts should have the author, when it was created, and the date and time it was made.
Should also be able to update any previous blog post.
Should automatically log out if the user is idle for too long.

I am attempting to learn how to use Bulma in this assignment so it's admittedly a little rough looking

This is definitely the hardest assignment so far and even with studying and using references.
It does run but for some reason you cannot login or register and I have been looking through my files. 

But you are able to see the Render deployed website even if funcationality is limited.
