# TechBlog

The purpose of this assignment is to create a CMS style blog that allows users to sign in, create posts, comment on those posts.
More importantly to have authorization on the page so that users can sign in with an email and password and then be able to resign in.

There should be navigation between the homepage, the dashboard and the log out pages.
And blog posts should have the author, when it was created, and the date and time it was made.
Should also be able to update any previous blog post.
Should automatically log out if the user is idle for too long.

This is definitely the hardest assignment so far and after studying other references I struggle with it. 

This code works, but render doesn't like the code for some reason
